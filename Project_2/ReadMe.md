### Using spectrometer to predict Soil Properties

The aim of this project was to predict soil nutrients (N, P, K, C%) amount using images taken from a spectrometer made using Raspberry Pi and Pi camera
The <code>image_cleaning.ipynb</code> contains the code and its visualization for converting the spectrum image to reflectance value.
The <code>pls_model.py</code> file contains the implementation of Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) algorithm on the reflectance values obtained.
