The main aim of this project was to predict the Soil Organic Carbon Percent using a self created setup which incorporates the use of an
Android Smartphone for capturing the soil sample images. The setup had unifrom lightning and also contained a dimmer for adjusting the 
brightness while taking the images.
The captured images were pre processed and cropped to relevant size for prediction. A deep CNN was used, which on experimenting gave best
results with 9 layers.<br/ > 
The final code can be seen in the <code>CNN.py</code> file.<br/ ><pre></pre>
The <code>sample.jpg</code> file shows what the sample images taken from the mobile camera looked like.

This project was undertaken so as to develop a cheap and handy way to predict the soil organic carbon percent directly in the field.
